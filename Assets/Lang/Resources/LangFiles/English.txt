descricao_tecnologia_social_fogao_solar=It consists of capturing the sun's rays and converting the sun's radiation into heat for cooking food. Here we will use an old satellite dish covered in aluminum foil to improve the reflection of the sun and centralize the energy in a converging point.\n\nAn iron base is mounted where the pan will be hung at an angle that receives the heat generated by the reflection of the solar rays.\n\nClean energy without the emission of polluting gases, an initiative that can be greatly used in regions with great abundance of sun.
descricao_tecnologia_social_dessanilizador=It consists of transforming brackish water into drinking water, for which a system is used to capture the water in pre-molded concrete plates with a glass cover which allows the passage of solar radiation (short waves) but inhibits the output of long waves. .\n\nA tarpaulin is placed on the floor of the structure, so that when the sun's rays increase the temperature and cause the water to evaporate and collect the salt.\n\nWhen the water evaporates and ends up condensing on the glass walls, that will contain an angle of around 45° for the water to slide and for it to be drained through a pipe, where it will be stored and ready for consumption.\n\nThis technology is not necessarily only for the consumption of people, but also for animals that often refuse water with a high salt content, which is the incidence of salt in the water.

politica_ra_label=The Augmented Reality experience is an immersive technology where the real world blends with the virtual. It is recommended that children use this technology only under adult supervision.\n\nBefore starting the experience, go to an open, brightly lit environment, free of obstacles, so that you don't bump into any objects and cause any accidents.
